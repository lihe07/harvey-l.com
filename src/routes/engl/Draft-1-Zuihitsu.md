1. Instructions

Walk until the streetlights twist with moonbeams. Collect the faces of people you meet. Ask the stone wall for its stories.  Miss the train. Gasp. Wait for the next one. Exchange five wrong words with a foreigner for one right smile. Dream the life behind the stained glass window. Wear it for a while. Then, let the cycle conquer the highway between cities. Burn the pedals. Watch the sun push its way into the slit between buildings over the Thames and know this: belonging is not gifted.

2. Exploring Oxford

The impatient change rinings of Magdalen Tower rendered the street more crowded. The voices of passing tourists drowned out the police car sirens. Despite obscured by people's backs, already existed in my memory is the stone paved street. The unevenness from centuries of traffic feels the same as yesterday. My third time stepping over them appeared like a thousandth: the Victorian Fountain, icecream shop, and the bridge have become a part of me.

However, it is my mind deliberately counterfeited memory and inserted these images into my nature, blocking me from perceiving the very moment. The soothing sense of home is not more than a beautiful dream, with blurry background of castles and towers.

The town is living: the disrupted flow of crowds from street to street created a symphony of echoes. The towers and rooftops twisted in the sky, projecting shadows that invite pauses and reflections. One should not be distracted by the fatigue of exploring. Venture into the shadows, where the history lives. Or, track the scent of flowers and bird singing and break a way into the secret gardens.
