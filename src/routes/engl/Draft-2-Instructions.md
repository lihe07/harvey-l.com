Walk until the streetlights twist with moonbeams. Collect the faces of people you meet. Ask the stone wall for its stories.  Miss the train. Gasp. Wait for the next one. Exchange five wrong words with a foreigner for one right smile. Dream the life behind the stained glass window. Wear it for a while. Then, let the cycle conquer the highway between cities. Burn the pedals. Watch the sun push its way into the slit between buildings over the Thames and know this: belonging is not gifted.
