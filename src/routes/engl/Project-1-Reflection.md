## Reflection Questions

1. What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.

As the very beginning project in our ENGL1101 course, the first week video helps us to identify a challenge to working on, and integrated it into the course agenda. Referencing the WOVEN aspects of the communication, this project involves all factors and is a perfect kick-off for practicing communication strategies. The main intellectual goals of this assignment were to identify a challenge from WOVEN and getting to working on it already.

2. What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your project?

I would like to express clearly about my challenge in Oral communication. I analyzed the root causes of it, potential solutions, and how the study-abroad program will help me with it.

To make my argument visible and persuasive, I attempted to produce interesting and engaging video, using humors and examples.

3. Who is the intended audience for your artifact; why is this an appropriate audience? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?

Other students in the same class and general first-year Tech students are the intended audience. This is an appropriate audience because they are likely to face similar oral communication challenges, and they can relate to my experiences.
The choice of audience is reflected by my informal style and the use of humor. Also, the content is created to reflect the communication problem commonly found on CS students.

4. What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project? How do you make use of these features?

I am creating a vlog style recording, 60-90 seconds long. Some features used in this media including video editing, animation, and background music. Video editing allows me to cut unnecessary parts and make the video more engaging. Animation helps to make still images more dynamic and attentive.

5. If you had more time for revision, what would you change and why?

I would like to include some acting elements similar to what Ansel did. Also involving my friends in the video would make it more engaging.
