## Script

Hi, my name is Harvey, and I am a first-year student majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I was born and raised in Beijing, and I am currently in London as a part of the First-Year Semester Abroad program. I am excited to take Dr. Jennifer's English 1101 class, about overcoming challenges in my communication skills.

I was always a quiet person, typical of CS students. During my free time, I found myself spending hours at the library, coding and gaming, rather than engaging in conversations with others. This made me realize that I needed to improve my oral communication skills.

With the help of Dr. Lux's class, I am determined to overcome this challenge. The diverse environment of London and Oxford will provide me with ample opportunities to practice my communication skills.
