## Script

Hi, my name is Harvey, and I'm a first-year student majoring in Computer Science at Georgia Tech. I'm here in London as part of the First-Year Semester Abroad program. I'm in Dr. Jennifer's English 1101 class, and this video is about my communication challenges

I've always been a quiet person. Like a lot of computer science students, I'm more comfortable with code than I am with conversation.

Additionally English not being my first language adds another layer of difficulty. I speak slowly, and sometimes, I just can't find the right words.

But being in London has forced me out of my comfort zone. Every day, I'm in an energetic environment with new cultures and situations. I'm learning to listen more, to read non-verbal cues, or to just be present.

I still have a long way to go, but I feel more confident about overcoming this challenge. I'm learning that communication not only finding the right words, but also trying to connect. And that's a challenge I'm excited to keep working on.
