# My Oxford, and a Thousand Others

## Text

### Part 1

The relentless, monotonous pressure of a self-imposed routine.

The feeling of being sealed in.

### Part 2: The Accidental Pause

An unwelcome, jarring interruption that forces me out of the mental fortress.

### Part 3

A fragile, conscious shift from observing to participating.

## Photos

1. Photo of the window with rain droplets.

2. Photo of broken bicycles on the roadside.

3. Photo or Video of tourists passing at the City Center.

4. A photograph down a dark, narrow alleyway.

5. A shot of my bike in forest background.
