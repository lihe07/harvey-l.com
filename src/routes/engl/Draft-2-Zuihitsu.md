1. Instructions

Walk until the streetlights twist with moonbeams. Collect the faces of people you meet. Ask the stone wall for its stories.  Miss the train. Gasp. Wait for the next one. Exchange five wrong words with a foreigner for one right smile. Dream the life behind the stained glass window. Wear it for a while. Then, let the cycle conquer the highway between cities. Burn the pedals. Watch the sun push its way into the slit between buildings over the Thames and know this: belonging is not gifted.

2. Exploring Oxford

The impatient change rinings of Magdalen Tower rendered the street more crowded. The voices of passing tourists drowned out the police car sirens. Despite obscured by people's backs, already existed in my memory is the stone paved street. The unevenness from centuries of traffic feels the same as yesterday. My third time stepping over them appeared like a thousandth: the Victorian Fountain, icecream shop, and the bridge have become a part of me.

However, it is my mind deliberately counterfeited memory and inserted these images into my nature, blocking me from perceiving the very moment. The soothing sense of home is not more than a beautiful dream, with blurry background of castles and towers.

The town is living: the disrupted flow of crowds from street to street created a symphony of echoes. The towers and rooftops twisted in the sky, projecting shadows that invite pauses and reflections. One should not be distracted by the fatigue of exploring. Venture into the shadows, where the history lives. Or, track the scent of flowers and bird singing and break a way into the secret gardens.

3. Ashmolean Museum

Wandering on the wooden floor of the Ashmolean Museum, I looked around for artworks that caught my eyes. Quickly browsing through the still object paintings and modern abstract arts, I found myself overwhelmed by the artistic analysis and contexts of each piece. I often struggle with aesthetic appreciation, and generally artworks with historical context appeals to me more. The oil painting of Oxford street view therefore came to my attention.

The oil painting was created in 1810, 200 years ago, and depicts the High Street of Oxford. To my surprise, there is no much difference between the view hundreds years ago and today: the college buildings on the roadside, bell towers and paved sidewalks are still there. The only difference is the buses and cycles.

I can hardly believe, between the pictures, were the stories of nearly three generations of people. These people walked on the same street, under the same sky, but thinking and living in completely different ways. A few months is enough for a person to experience transformative changes. Ups and downs, joys and sorrows fully occupied me before the study abroad program. I was faced life-changing decisions such as choosing my college life and career path. Just one glimpse, I might end up in another country, a different life, and never return to this street.

How difficult it is for us to keep thinking about the future, while the past is already gone? Glancing at the painting, I felt a sense of peace. Despite how everything changes, the street remains the same: the stories told, the people walked, and the sky above. The street is a witness of time, and I am just a passerby.

But does our choice really matter that much? Just like the town, some parts of our life is not meant to be changed. Moving from city to city, living another life style, or even changing the way we think, my identity is still the same. I am still the person who walked on the same street, under the same sky.

This has provoked me to contemplate our identity more deeply. In fact, the same question has baffled many philosophers and thinkers. Is the High Street in 1810 the same as the one in 2025? Is me in Atlanta a few weeks ago the same as me in Oxford? The question resonates with me when I am learning David Hume's thoughts, and now the painting has become a physical representation of the philosophical question.

I found Hume's perspective on identity particularly interesting. Instead of relying on a non-material ego, he argues that identity is mere a bundle of perceptions or properties. The High Street is not a single entity, but a collection of buildings, people, and stories. Overtime, some buildings were renovated, some were gone and some were added, but there were always things that remained constant.

Indeed, the questions about identity are not not settled, but searching for new ways to think about it is an enjoyable process. The oil paintings at Ashmolean Museum have droven me to think about the relationship between identity and time, and how our perception of self is shaped by the continuity of experiences.
