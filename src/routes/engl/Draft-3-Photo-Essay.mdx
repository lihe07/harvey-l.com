Because of my new travel plans, **there has been a change in topic.** New title:

# Where the Dawn Finally Broke

## My Oxford, and a Thousand Others

The outer world was merely a place of broken promises, so I built a fortress against the unpredictable: my schedule. It was not a simple timetable, which is vulnerable to sudden changes, but a comprehensive priority queue and a delicate algorithm running in my mind. When the rain cancelled my planned bike ride on Wednesday, I was not fazed. In no time, I had reallocated my tasks. From my window, I calmly watched the rain, accompnied with the noise of people rushing to the hall for shelter.

My proud feeling of control was shattered. Walking to an Korean Restaurants on a Friday night, I just realized that there are at least two Oxfordes. Spiraling streets, ancient spires, and the blend of colorful raincoats with the stones, it is a city of fresh discoveries, of laughter echoing in alleys and postcards coming to life. But that wasn't mine. My Oxford was confined to four walls and a laptop screen, set to the soundtrack of a steady, monotonous rain.

Seated in the restaurant, I didn't participate in the conversation, nor did I looked at the menu. "I will get the same as you," I stared at my phone, scrolling through emails and websites, trying to feel more organized. My friends' voices faded into the background. "We have to leave early to catch the bus...Where are you going? ... Edinburgh?" *Yes, Edinburgh.* Quickly searching on the map, I found the only bus with available seats. "From London to Edninburgh. 10h 25m. Only a few tickets left." I swiftly tapped the button with my shaking fingers. I don't have time to think for now, the bus leaves in 2 hours from London.

"Someone please take my bowl of rice," I said, standing up in my friends' confusion. "I have to catch the bus. See you in Edinburgh." Sprinting to get my backpack, I dashed out of the restaurant. The rain had stopped, leaving the streets glistening under the sun setting. Oxford railway station, Paddington, Underground, Victoria coach station, and a blur of motion.
