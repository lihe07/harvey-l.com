Because of my new travel plans, **there has been a change in topic.**

# Where the Dawn Finally Broke

## My Oxford, and a Thousand Others

The outer world was merely a place of broken promises, so I built a fortress against the unpredictable: my schedule. It was not a simple timetable, which is vulnerable to sudden changes, but a comprehensive priority queue and a delicate algorithm running in my mind. When the rain cancelled my planned bike ride on Wednesday, I was not fazed. In no time, I had reallocated my tasks. From my window, I calmly watched the rain, accompnied with the noise of people rushing to the hall for shelter.

My proud feeling of control was shattered. Walking to an Korean Restaurants on a Friday night, I just realized that there are at least two Oxfordes. Spiraling streets, ancient spires, and the blend of colorful raincoats with the stones, it is a city of fresh discoveries, of laughter echoing in alleys and postcards coming to life. But that wasn't mine. My Oxford was confined to four walls and a laptop screen, set to the soundtrack of a steady, monotonous rain.
