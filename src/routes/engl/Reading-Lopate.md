Reference: On the Necessity of Turning Oneself into a Character

Lopate's article certainly provided me with novel and refreshing perspectives on writing personal essays. I really like the part where he emphasizes turning oneself into a character. Before encountering this idea, I never considered the reader's view of my personal essays. They are mostly myself writing for nobody else. They are mostly written for myself, with many details implied, and I automatically assumed that the reader already understood my feelings. When I reviewed my essays, I never found these mistakes, because I couldn't effectively ignore my knowledge about myself.

However, Lopate's suggestion of acquiring some distance from oneself is very informative. It not only helps with easier understanding of the reader's perspective, but also with the shaping of a "legible character". This is the second point that I need to pay more attention to. Lopate argued that authors should be wary of using extreme aspects: shaping the character to be too weird or too boring are both indesireble. "The charm of the ordinary", as Lopate puts it, is best for readers to relate to the character. I often fell into this pitfall when I was trying to elaborate on one specific personality of myself. By extremely enlarging this one specific aspect, my character became flat and uninteresting. I will try to avoid this in my future writing.
