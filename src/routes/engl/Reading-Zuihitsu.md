> People who are learning an art generally claim that it is best not to inadvertently let others know about your attempts
until you are accomplished. The way to really impress is to polish your craft in secret before making it public. But
someone who says such things will never acquire any art.
A person who mingles with skilled practitioners while he himself is still inexpert, and isn’t ashamed of their
ridicule and laughter but calmly and devotedly perseveres in his practice even if he has no special gift, will continue
to progress and not grow lax with the passing years, and will finally outdo the man of talent who lacks dedication.
He will attain mastery in his art, continue to increase his skill and gain an unequalled reputation in his field.
Some truly great practitioners were reviled for their lack of skill when they first began, and indeed had dreadful
faults. But in every art we find the same thing – such a man has maintained a deep respect for the rules of his art,
and not indulged his own whims, with the result that he has become a renowned master who draws crowds of
disciples to his door.

The 150th section resonates with me most: it begins with a statement that I found really interesting. It's best to polish in secret before making it public. I had the same belief when I was either working on a side programming project or an essay. I feel uncomfortable to share my draft with others before I think it is perfect - and generally it never is. As a result, I hardly made any progress, and many ideas were abandoned before they even had a chance to grow. In the excerpt, Kenko argues that this is a flawed approach. He suggests that even still inexpert, one should not be ashamed of their ridicule, but devote to practice. By practicing open-minded, one without special gift may eventually outdo the talented one who lacks dedication. This reminder really speaks to me a lot.

In general, I might describe Kenko's Essays as collections of unfinished and unrelated thoughts. Many sections appeared to be unorganized and some even have seemingly contrasting ideas. For example, the 15th section first suggests going to a journey makes one feel awake and alive. However, at the end, Kendo wrote "Withdrawing quietly to a retreat at a temple or shrine is also delightful." This sentence disrupts the whole flow of the section. However, I think this is also the unique style of Zuihitsu. It is a collection of thoughts that are not necessarily related to each other, but they directly reflect the author's personal experiences and feelings. This style, with the great freedom of expression, could help a lot for me to jotting down some of the fast moving ideas that emerge during my study abroad experience.
