The part I found to be most interesting in this reading is the author's description of the barber's shop. The line by line comparison between the environment in Sydney and Cincinnati is insightful. The author successfully captures the essential similarities between the two places, while usage of informal works such as "homey" and "welcoming vibe" renders the text more relatable. I was also surprised by abundance of details in description of the shop.

Multiple devices are applied by the author to capture readers' attention. I found the length of paragraphs to be comfortable, and the transition between them effectively emphasized logical breaks in beginning, middle, and end of the story. Dialogue between the narrator and the barber, Michael, is also well-placed and contributed to a natural and vivid storytelling.

In my opinion, the author's conclusion in the final paragraph about pursuing passions is a bit far-fetched. However, I do believe that the author do sincerely learned to perceive the beauty within a normal day. In fact, composing this article already proved this point. This is also a valuable lesson to me: the ability to observe and reflect from such a simple experience is a skill that I can apply to my own life.
