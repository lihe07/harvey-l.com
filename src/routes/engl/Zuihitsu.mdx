1. Instructions

Walk until the streetlights twist with moonbeams. Collect the faces of people you meet. Ask the stone wall for its stories.  Miss the train. Gasp. Wait for the next one. Exchange five wrong words with a foreigner for one right smile. Dream the life behind the stained glass window. Wear it for a while. Then, let the cycle conquer the highway between cities. Burn the pedals. Watch the sun push its way into the slit between buildings over the Thames and know this: belonging is not gifted.

2. Exploring Oxford

The impatient change rinings of Magdalen Tower rendered the street more crowded. The voices of passing tourists drowned out the police car sirens. Despite obscured by people's backs, already existed in my memory is the stone paved street. The unevenness from centuries of traffic feels the same as yesterday. My third time stepping over them appeared like a thousandth: the Victorian Fountain, icecream shop, and the bridge have become a part of me.

However, it is my mind deliberately counterfeited memory and inserted these images into my nature, blocking me from perceiving the very moment. The soothing sense of home is not more than a beautiful dream, with blurry background of castles and towers.

The town is living: the disrupted flow of crowds from street to street created a symphony of echoes. The towers and rooftops twisted in the sky, projecting shadows that invite pauses and reflections. One should not be distracted by the fatigue of exploring. Venture into the shadows, where the history lives. Or, track the scent of flowers and bird singing and break a way into the secret gardens.

3. Ashmolean Museum

Wandering on the wooden floor of the Ashmolean Museum, I looked around for artworks that caught my eyes. Quickly browsing through the still object paintings and modern abstract arts, I found myself overwhelmed by the artistic analysis and contexts of each piece. I often struggle with aesthetic appreciation, and generally artworks with historical context appeals to me more. The oil painting of Oxford street view therefore came to my attention.

  View of the High Street, Oxford.
  Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851)
</p>

The oil painting was created in 1810, 200 years ago, and depicts the High Street of Oxford. To my surprise, there is no much difference between the view hundreds years ago and today: the college buildings on the roadside, bell towers and paved sidewalks are still there. The only difference is the buses and cycles.

I can hardly believe, between the pictures, were the stories of nearly three generations of people. These people walked on the same street, under the same sky, but thinking and living in completely different ways. A few months is enough for a person to experience transformative changes. Ups and downs, joys and sorrows fully occupied me before the study abroad program. I was faced life-changing decisions such as choosing my college life and career path. Just one glimpse, I might end up in another country, a different life, and never return to this street.

How difficult it is for us to keep thinking about the future, while the past is already gone? Glancing at the painting, I felt a sense of peace. Despite how everything changes, the street remains the same: the stories told, the people walked, and the sky above. The street is a witness of time, and I am just a passerby.

But does our choice really matter that much? Just like the town, some parts of our life is not meant to be changed. Moving from city to city, living another life style, or even changing the way we think, my identity is still the same. I am still the person who walked on the same street, under the same sky.

This has provoked me to contemplate our identity more deeply. In fact, the same question has baffled many philosophers and thinkers. Is the High Street in 1810 the same as the one in 2025? Is me in Atlanta a few weeks ago the same as me in Oxford? The question resonates with me when I am learning David Hume's thoughts, and now the painting has become a physical representation of the philosophical question.

I found Hume's perspective on identity particularly interesting. Instead of relying on a non-material ego, he argues that identity is mere a bundle of perceptions or properties. The High Street is not a single entity, but a collection of buildings, people, and stories. Overtime, some buildings were renovated, some were gone and some were added, but there were always things that remained constant.

Indeed, the questions about identity are not not settled, but searching for new ways to think about it is an enjoyable process. The oil paintings at Ashmolean Museum have droven me to think about the relationship between identity and time, and how our perception of self is shaped by the continuity of experiences.

4. Food

I hate instant noodles. Perhaps it’s because their strong smell deceives with promises of flavor they never deliver, or perhaps it’s because my parents kept repeating how unhealthy they are.

Once a year, during the traditional Spring Festival, my family visits our hometown in Inner Mongolia. It was during these visits that I formed my second memory of instant noodles. One of my uncles, for instance, runs a meat wholesale business, and I usually stay at his place. Something needs to be clarified here: when one imagines a wholesale business, it's easy to picture elegant storefronts, smiling staff, and dazzling shelves. I too imagined this, only to be shocked. None of it was real. Instead, there was the unpleasant smell of raw meat, flies constantly swatted away, and cramped stores no bigger than a minivan -- my uncle's among them. At lunchtime, almost all the shop owners would pull out instant noodles from the refrigerators behind them. I used to believe my parents had moved to Beijing to escape these mandatory cup noodles.

I realized how wrong this theory was when my father became a freelancer, working in multiple locations. Each time he went away, instant noodles began to dominate our meals. I often tried to exercise my right, as a child, to skip meals entirely. Unfortunately, my mother did not respect this young boy's protest. Forgetting her earlier warnings about nutrition, she now lectured me endlessly about never skipping meals. At that point, all I could do was look forward to real food, homemade by both my parents, whenever my father returned at some uncertain time.

Instant noodles take less than five minutes and a kettle of boiling water. Cooking real food takes at least half an hour in a proper kitchen. That's why noodles became the meal of those who have no choice. My uncle, nearing seventy, no longer has the energy to cook formal meals while running his business. My mother, whose teaching job begins precisely at 8 a.m. and requires a long commute, simply doesn't have the time.

These days the reality isn't much better. My mother has just finished her hospitalization and still needs daily injections, and my father's job remains unchanged. But I am now mature enough to overcome instant noodles -- by learning how to cook for myself.

In my Oxford dorm, I once again face my old fear, smaller than before but with familiar worries. Determined to spend as much time as possible reviewing course content, I rarely have the time for walks to restaurants. Yet it feels completely different now. No one but me sets the rhythm of my days. The fear is gone because this time, I have a choice.

5. Pitt Rivers and Natural History

The Natural History Museum, sitting at the center of Oxford University, looks almost like a railway station, with a single great hall and a pointed roof of iron and glass. Upon stepping inside, I notice a unique odor I can only describe as “museum smell.” The giant dinosaur skeletons and surrounding sculptures of great scientists remind me that this is a place meant to inspire awe for snapshots of history. Yet I find myself more aware of the smaller tragedies imprisoned inside glass cases.

Reefs make up my best memories of the ocean. I can clearly recall vacations spent on beaches in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, with fish of all sizes swimming beside me over corals colored like a complete rainbow. But here, they are bone-white, torn apart, and trapped inside small boxes of brownish liquid. Eternity has been granted to them, yet the glass preserves only their ghostly images. Soon I realize why they look familiar: countless documentaries and news reports have shown bleached reefs as warnings of dying oceans under global warming. It is alarming—the white skeletons inside the museum are not just relics, but also omens of a possible future.

On the second floor, I encounter a collection of bird specimens. At first surprised by its sheer size, I am quickly overtaken by unease. A closer look reveals that their feathers are all wrong: messy, dull, arranged as if in alarm. The vibrant sheen of living plumage has been replaced by visible artificial paints. Worst of all are their eyes, made of glass beads, reflecting no light nor vitality, only a fixed, empty stare. Their bodies are posed mid-flight, but instead of motion they convey only awkward stillness.

The Pitt Rivers Museum gave me the same feeling, but in a different way. It is filled with human cultural relics, yet unlike other museums, which usually separate their collections with space and provide detailed descriptions for each item, Pitt Rivers has them crammed together in crowded glass drawers. The lighting is dim, so that the textures of the objects can hardly be seen. This creates not clarity but an overwhelming sense of accumulation, as though history itself were pressing in from all sides.

Looking down from the top floor, past skeletons, glass cases, and sculptures, I feel the weight of all these frozen lives. The museum has preserved their forms and offered them immortality, but only in exchange for color, song, and the vital spark that once made them real. They have been saved, but also lost.

6. Learning from Others: Voices from the Past

The glowing computer screen has become my portal to the past: I just traveled the globe through video calls catching up with my friends starting their freshman year from the west to the east coast of the United States, up to Vancouver, across the Atlantic to Oxford and back to Hong Kong and China. Some of them are the faces from my high school class, and some of them are from middle school. Many of their voices and faces are still fresh in my memory, but some also surprised me. They are now different, subtlely and profoundly.

Although only four years ago, I can barely remember anything about my middle school except the sudden change brought by COVID-19. The pandemic has disrupted my normal life and memory for everything happened during that period. It was my classmate Zeng, now a freshman at Oxford University, brought up the Great War of Class 17 and 18. "It happened before and during the pandemic," "No wonder I don't remember it at all." Reason unclear, the two neighboring classes had a fierce conflict online. Upon we arrived home, the first thing is to grab the phone and argue with each other. We finally reached a truce after an exchange of snacks and beverages.

Hearing the story again, from a friend who is going to study at the same place for my study abroad, I felt like watching a movie. The kids who were fighting are now adults, ready for higher educaton and daunting futures. After rounds of video calls, I still feel the strange disonance, which is the superimposition of the past and the present. We have grown up, yet, these moments always remind me the kids inside us.

7. Botanical Garden: The Unlikely Native

The word "exotic" describes my feeling as a double international student here in Oxford. After all these experiences, I think I understand the feeling of being a transplant naturally. Wandering through the garden's delicate collections, I found plants around the globe. Their brief labels just has names on it, but I can perfectly imagine thier own story of travel.

It was amidst the quiet stroll that a high-pitched squawk shattered the tranquility.I traced the sound to see a bright green with a red beak parrot perched on a tree branch. My bird knowledge told me it was an Alexandrine parrot. Its plumage added a shoking splash of tropical color to the muted tones of English sky. This type of parrot is widely kept as pets, so my first thought was that it escaped from a home. The loud bird sing reminded me its longliness, far from its native home of Southeast Asia.

Watching it calling out, notifying everyone in the garden for its presence, I felt a strange kinship. Here was another "exotic" being, far from its native land, making a life for itself and calling for the uncertain fate as an invasive species.

8. Through the Window

It was my very first time at a Quaker meeting house. Although I came prepared, I was still surprised by the simplicity of the environment: benches arranged in a circle, a plain wooden floor, and a wooden-framed window letting in the light of the morning sun. Before I entered, the room was already filled with a quiet, contemplative atmosphere, as if everyone were waiting for something to happen. Everything went as expected. I soon found a seat and joined the circle.

Gazing out the window for maybe ten minutes, I calmed my heart, still racing from the excitement and the intense cycling. There was almost nothing outside—an old stone wall cutting the sky in half, leaving only the pale, cloudless blue above. Occasionally, a bird crossed in a rapid dark flash.

Noise came and went. I began to notice a subtle feeling within me: it had always been there, but only in the brief silences could I hear it. The feeling was not tranquility, but urgency. Following the rhythm of the meeting, I felt my heart beating faster and faster.

Thoughts came and went. I thought about the past, the present, and the future. Diving deeper into my consciousness, I found myself confronting fear. I had never realized how much fear had invaded my life. It was everywhere, often disguised as a kind of subconscious awkwardness. And yet it was also concrete, like a shadow that followed me everywhere. I was always afraid of pursuing my imperfect ideas, and whenever I tried to write one down or look it up, I was stopped by an intense awkwardness. Without knowing why, I often halted my thinking and avoided facing it.

But today, I carried a different faith, and felt more at ease with that same awkwardness. Following it back, I was able to discover the origin of my fear: conflicting experiences. I used to be so proud of my inspirations. But during an independent research project in high school, I realized my ideas were not as original as I thought. The simple act of checking references and reading papers became the source of my inner conflict. Rational thinking told me to verify my ideas, but experience told me to protect them.

The end of the meeting came quickly. I was not able to finish my thoughts, and it took only seconds to return from the depths of my mind to the present. I stayed for a while, looking again out the window. The bird was gone, and the sky was still the same pale blue.
