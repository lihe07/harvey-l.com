1. What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.

The Photo Essay assignment is a direct combination of all WOVEN aspects. Writing: 750 words essay. Oral: final presentation in the class. Visual: photos taken by myself. Electronic: layout on my personal website and photo editing.

More than the course theme of Composition, I also learned to be more observant of my surroundings. By putting myself in a completely unfamiliar environment, I was forced to pay attention to the details of my daily life. From this, I was able to create a few thoughtful photos that fit into my essay theme.

2. What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your artifact?

My whole essay is about my unexpected journey to Edinburgh. I attempted to convey my feelings of excitement, curiosity, and awe as I explored the city. Through my photos, I aimed to invite the audience to ponder upon these seemingly random moments that I captured. I also tried to use muted videos mixed with text to create a more immersive experience for the audience.

3. Who is the intended audience for your artifact; why is this an appropriate audience? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?

General audience. Different from my previous project, I tried to make my essay more accessible to a wider audience. I avoided using too many  references to the FYSA program and instead focused on universal themes such as travel, exploration, and discovery.
The photos and the experiences should be relatable to anyone who has ever traveled to a new place.

4. What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project? How do you make use of these features?

The photo essay genre combines visual and textual elements. I made use of this by carefully selecting photos that aided my writing. I initially put all my photos into photo groups with similar themes, and then I wrote the essay around these themes.
Notably, the Exploration section does not contain any writings beside the photos. This is intentional as the project is delivered in a Oral presentation format to the class. In this section, I wanted to let the photos speak for themselves and allow the audience to interpret them in their own way, while I sharing my personal stories behind each photo.

5. If you had more time for revision, what would you change and why?

I wish to add more background information at the beginning of my essay. I feel that the introduction is a bit weak and does not fully set the stage for the rest of the essay. I would like to write about my life in Oxford, and especially express my emotions before the trip.

Also, I wish to add more personal reflections on my past. Currently, the essay focuses more on the present moment and my experiences in Edinburgh. I would like to connect these experiences to my past and reflect on how they have shaped me as a person.
