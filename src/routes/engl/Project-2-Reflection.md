1. What were the main intellectual goals of the assignment? Please situate these goals in terms of the course theme and in terms of the communication strategies you were to learn or practice.

The Zuihitsu project is a direct training of the Writing aspect of the WOVEN communication. Writing personal essays is obviously an essential part of the course "Composition I".
The goals of this assignment include:

- Practice writing in a non-linear, associative style that reflects the flow of thoughts and feelings.
- Explore personal experiences and reflections in a way that connects to the writing.
- Experiment with the Zuihitsu genre but also incorporate new formats (such as pictures, videos, and sketches).

2. What is your argument or purpose? How did you make the argument or purpose visible and persuasive in your artifact?

One of my core purpose is to improve my writing skills, and confront the challenges of writing in a personal style. Previously, Zuihitsu writings (随筆) is my greatest fear. They are required assignments for my literature classes, and I always struggle to find a topic that is both personal and meaningful. This time, I decided to embrace this challenge, and instead of viewing it as a daunting task, I saw it as an opportunity to express myself.

3. Who is the intended audience for your artifact; why is this an appropriate audience? How is your choice of audience reflected in your artifact?

People in the FYSA cohort. Some of the contexts and experiences of my writing are only shared by my peers and instructors. I intentionally implied many details so the general audience may not fully understand my writing.

4. What are the defining features of the genre or media that you are using in this project? How do you make use of these features?

The Zuihitsu genre is characterized by its non-linear structure and personal reflections. To add on that, I also incorporated multimedia elements such as images to enhance the storytelling. These features allow me to create a more immersive experience for the readers.

5. If you had more time for revision, what would you change and why?

If more time were available, I would like to revise the first half of my essay. Initially, I still feel challenging to incorporate my personal experiences and feelings so the writings may appear to be rigid. Approaching the end of the project, I gradually found my voice and style, and I would like to apply this newfound confidence to the earlier sections of my essay.
