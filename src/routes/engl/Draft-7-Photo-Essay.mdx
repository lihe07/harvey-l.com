# Where the Dawn Finally Broke

## My Oxford, and a Thousand Others'

The outer world was a place of broken promises, so I built my fortress. It is not an ordinary timetable, which is vulnerable to storms and tempests. It is a delicate algorithm running in my mind, constantly toggling priorities. When the Wednesday rain came and washed away my cycling plan, I felt a quiet, satisfactory calmness. My fortress was safe. In no time, I had reallocated my tasks. From my window, I calmly watched the storm and listened the noise of people rushing to the hall for shelter.

My proud feeling of control was shattered on a Friday night. Walking to an Korean Restaurant with my friends, I just realized that there are at least two Oxfordes. Spiraling streets, ancient spires, and the blend of colorful raincoats with the stones, it is a city of fresh discoveries, of laughter echoing in alleys and postcards coming to life. But that wasn't mine. My Oxford was confined to four walls and a laptop screen, set to the soundtrack of a steady, monotonous rain.

Seated in the restaurant. Disengaged from the conversation. Skipped the menu. "I will get the same as you." Stared at my phone under the table, scrolling through emails and websites. Not paying attention to the surroundings, I was not even a qualified spectator of my own evening. Only a few of my friends' words pierced through the veil.

...leave early to catch the bus...

...where are you going...?

...Edinburgh?

*Yes, Edinburgh.* Quickly searching on the map, I found the only bus with available seats. "From London to Edninburgh. 10h 25m. Only a few tickets left." I swiftly tapped the button with my tremoring fingers. I don't have time to think for now, the bus leaves in 2 hours from London.

The control slightly took over before I clicked the final button. *This is not optimized. How are you getting to London in time? Think about the assignments? ...* Deep in my heart, the voice answered, *That is the point.*

"Someone please take my bowl of rice," I said, standing up in my friends' confusion. "I have to catch the bus. See you in Edinburgh." Sprinting to get my backpack, I dashed out of the restaurant. The rain had stopped, leaving the streets glistening under the sun setting.

Oxford railway station, Paddington, The Underground, Victoria, and a blur of motion.

## The Longest Shortcut Home

I have always enjoyed long-distance drivings. The interior of a coach forms a tunnel, where the only world is me, my E-book and my earphones. Time pooled in this pressurized tube lited by dim blue light.

Many hours passed before I messaged my friends:

See you in Edinburgh.

Edinburgh? We are going to Highlands and Glasgow.

So the plan I made an hour ago disollved in this misinformation. For a second I waited for anxiety to rise. It didn’t. Once you are off the map, an extra detour doesn't matter. I cleared my mind and booked a hostel near the Castle, a three taps decision. Then a surprise: Emmanuel would also be there, just not overnight. The arrival of companionship is as unexpected as its departure.

  <p class="h-fit m0!">
Motion sickness woke me up&mdash;first time in five years. Quick observation revealed that the bus is pitching and swaying through Scottish hills. The four forgiving lanes were replaced by a dark coiling strip. Somewhere in that nausea-softened interval, the paradox of control became clearer. The tighter you gripped, the more fragile equilibrium became. Here, with nothing optimized -- not route, not companions, not vestibular -- I almost see a faint seam of colors forming in the darkness. Dawn is never beautiful at the planned hour.

## The Fortress has Windows

    Boarded the south bound train, I sit next to the window. Earlier, the uninvited dawn had forced me to open.  Now, the sunset invites me to pause. Five hours for depth.  Five hours for looking out and back.  I still run the algorithm, but i t in cludes a field it once omitted: “blank-space.” The sun continues to chase the train. I let the scene unfold without converting it into a plan.

Fields, pylons, a smear of orange collapsing into a blurred band—<i>unremarkable unless you weren’t looking.</i>

The fortress is still here: busy hours, quiet, doors I shut, but light comes in. A orange cat will sit outside my window tomorrow. A rainbow might appear after rain over Mansfield. They enter, cross, leave.

The fortress has windows.
