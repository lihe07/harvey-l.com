1. Instructions

Walk until the streetlights twist with moonbeams. Collect the faces of people you meet. Ask the stone wall for its stories.  Miss the train. Gasp. Wait for the next one. Exchange five wrong words with a foreigner for one right smile. Dream the life behind the stained glass window. Wear it for a while. Then, let the cycle conquer the highway between cities. Burn the pedals. Watch the sun push its way into the slit between buildings over the Thames and know this: belonging is not gifted.

2. Exploring Oxford

The impatient change rinings of Magdalen Tower rendered the street more crowded. The voices of passing tourists drowned out the police car sirens. Despite obscured by people's backs, already existed in my memory is the stone paved street. The unevenness from centuries of traffic feels the same as yesterday. My third time stepping over them appeared like a thousandth: the Victorian Fountain, icecream shop, and the bridge have become a part of me.

However, it is my mind deliberately counterfeited memory and inserted these images into my nature, blocking me from perceiving the very moment. The soothing sense of home is not more than a beautiful dream, with blurry background of castles and towers.

The town is living: the disrupted flow of crowds from street to street created a symphony of echoes. The towers and rooftops twisted in the sky, projecting shadows that invite pauses and reflections. One should not be distracted by the fatigue of exploring. Venture into the shadows, where the history lives. Or, track the scent of flowers and bird singing and break a way into the secret gardens.

3. Ashmolean Museum

Wandering on the wooden floor of the Ashmolean Museum, I looked around for artworks that caught my eyes. Quickly browsing through the still object paintings and modern abstract arts, I found myself overwhelmed by the artistic analysis and contexts of each piece. I often struggle with aesthetic appreciation, and generally artworks with historical context appeals to me more. The oil painting of Oxford street view therefore came to my attention.

The oil painting was created in 1810, 200 years ago, and depicts the High Street of Oxford. To my surprise, there is no much difference between the view hundreds years ago and today: the college buildings on the roadside, bell towers and paved sidewalks are still there. The only difference is the buses and cycles.

I can hardly believe, between the pictures, were the stories of nearly three generations of people. These people walked on the same street, under the same sky, but thinking and living in completely different ways. A few months is enough for a person to experience transformative changes. Ups and downs, joys and sorrows fully occupied me before the study abroad program. I was faced life-changing decisions such as choosing my college life and career path. Just one glimpse, I might end up in another country, a different life, and never return to this street.

How difficult it is for us to keep thinking about the future, while the past is already gone? Glancing at the painting, I felt a sense of peace. Despite how everything changes, the street remains the same: the stories told, the people walked, and the sky above. The street is a witness of time, and I am just a passerby.

But does our choice really matter that much? Just like the town, some parts of our life is not meant to be changed. Moving from city to city, living another life style, or even changing the way we think, my identity is still the same. I am still the person who walked on the same street, under the same sky.

This has provoked me to contemplate our identity more deeply. In fact, the same question has baffled many philosophers and thinkers. Is the High Street in 1810 the same as the one in 2025? Is me in Atlanta a few weeks ago the same as me in Oxford? The question resonates with me when I am learning David Hume's thoughts, and now the painting has become a physical representation of the philosophical question.

I found Hume's perspective on identity particularly interesting. Instead of relying on a non-material ego, he argues that identity is mere a bundle of perceptions or properties. The High Street is not a single entity, but a collection of buildings, people, and stories. Overtime, some buildings were renovated, some were gone and some were added, but there were always things that remained constant.

Indeed, the questions about identity are not not settled, but searching for new ways to think about it is an enjoyable process. The oil paintings at Ashmolean Museum have droven me to think about the relationship between identity and time, and how our perception of self is shaped by the continuity of experiences.

4.

I hate instant noodles. Perhaps it’s because their strong smell deceives with promises of flavor they never deliver, or perhaps it’s because my parents kept repeating how unhealthy they are.

Once a year, during the traditional Spring Festival, my family visits our hometown in Inner Mongolia. It was during these visits that I formed my second memory of instant noodles. One of my uncles, for instance, runs a meat wholesale business, and I usually stay at his place. Something needs to be clarified here: when one imagines a wholesale business, it's easy to picture elegant storefronts, smiling staff, and dazzling shelves. I too imagined this, only to be shocked. None of it was real. Instead, there was the unpleasant smell of raw meat, flies constantly swatted away, and cramped stores no bigger than a minivan -- my uncle's among them. At lunchtime, almost all the shop owners would pull out instant noodles from the refrigerators behind them. I used to believe my parents had moved to Beijing to escape these mandatory cup noodles.

I realized how wrong this theory was when my father became a freelancer, working in multiple locations. Each time he went away, instant noodles began to dominate our meals. I often tried to exercise my right, as a child, to skip meals entirely. Unfortunately, my mother did not respect this young boy's protest. Forgetting her earlier warnings about nutrition, she now lectured me endlessly about never skipping meals. At that point, all I could do was look forward to real food, homemade by both my parents, whenever my father returned at some uncertain time.

Instant noodles take less than five minutes and a kettle of boiling water. Cooking real food takes at least half an hour in a proper kitchen. That's why noodles became the meal of those who have no choice. My uncle, nearing seventy, no longer has the energy to cook formal meals while running his business. My mother, whose teaching job begins precisely at 8 a.m. and requires a long commute, simply doesn't have the time.

These days the reality isn't much better. My mother has just finished her hospitalization and still needs daily injections, and my father's job remains unchanged. But I am now mature enough to overcome instant noodles -- by learning how to cook for myself.

In my Oxford dorm, I once again face my old fear, smaller than before but with familiar worries. Determined to spend as much time as possible reviewing course content, I rarely have the time for walks to restaurants. Yet it feels completely different now. No one but me sets the rhythm of my days. The fear is gone because this time, I have a choice.

5. Pitt Rivers and Natural History

The Natural History Museum, sitting at the center of Oxford University, looks almost like a railway station, with a single great hall and a pointed roof of iron and glass. Upon stepping inside, I notice a unique odor I can only describe as “museum smell.” The giant dinosaur skeletons and surrounding sculptures of great scientists remind me that this is a place meant to inspire awe for snapshots of history. Yet I find myself more aware of the smaller tragedies imprisoned inside glass cases.

Reefs make up my best memories of the ocean. I can clearly recall vacations spent on beaches in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, with fish of all sizes swimming beside me over corals colored like a complete rainbow. But here, they are bone-white, torn apart, and trapped inside small boxes of brownish liquid. Eternity has been granted to them, yet the glass preserves only their ghostly images. Soon I realize why they look familiar: countless documentaries and news reports have shown bleached reefs as warnings of dying oceans under global warming. It is alarming—the white skeletons inside the museum are not just relics, but also omens of a possible future.

On the second floor, I encounter a collection of bird specimens. At first surprised by its sheer size, I am quickly overtaken by unease. A closer look reveals that their feathers are all wrong: messy, dull, arranged as if in alarm. The vibrant sheen of living plumage has been replaced by visible artificial paints. Worst of all are their eyes, made of glass beads, reflecting no light nor vitality, only a fixed, empty stare. Their bodies are posed mid-flight, but instead of motion they convey only awkward stillness.

The Pitt Rivers Museum gave me the same feeling, but in a different way. It is filled with human cultural relics, yet unlike other museums, which usually separate their collections with space and provide detailed descriptions for each item, Pitt Rivers has them crammed together in crowded glass drawers. The lighting is dim, so that the textures of the objects can hardly be seen. This creates not clarity but an overwhelming sense of accumulation, as though history itself were pressing in from all sides.

Looking down from the top floor, past skeletons, glass cases, and sculptures, I feel the weight of all these frozen lives. The museum has preserved their forms and offered them immortality, but only in exchange for color, song, and the vital spark that once made them real. They have been saved, but also lost.
