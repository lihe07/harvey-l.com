## Introduction

VM detection, aka Anti-VM or Anti-Sandbox, is commonly used in mobile software protection to prevevnt reverse engineering and debugging.
On Android, some widely used methods including:

- checking the ABI list for detecting Android x86
- locating libhoudini.so
- checking CPU models, [CPUID](https://www.cyberbit.com/endpoint-security/anti-vm-and-anti-sandbox-explained/)

This post provides a method to detect Arm64 VMs by testing the CPU cache miss rate.

## Basic Idea

The majority of Arm64 VMs are based on QEMU, which is a popular open-source emulator. QEMU's primary focus is on functional emulation and speed, instead of microarchitectural simulation.
Therefore, by default, QEMU does not accurately emulate CPU cache.

A simple way to detect QEMU is to measure the cache miss rate. From my experiments, real Arm64 devices can achieve **0%** i-cache miss rate on deliberate code. While QEMU consistently reaching **100%** cache miss.

## Implementation

This C implementation tests the instruction cache (often referred as i-cache) miss rate over 100 iterations.
Compile the code with `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc` and test with `qemu-aarch64 -L /usr/aarch64-linux-gnu ./main`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>

int foo() { return 0; }

int bar() { return 1; }

typedef int (*func_ptr)();

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  // Alloc RWX
  func_ptr ptr = mmap(0x0, 0x5000, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE | PROT_EXEC,
                      MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);

  __builtin_memcpy(ptr, foo, 8); // Copy foo
  __builtin___clear_cache((char *)ptr, (char *)ptr + 8);

  int x = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    x += ptr();
  }

  __builtin_memcpy(ptr, bar, 8); // Copy bar
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    x += ptr();
  }

  printf("Cache misses: %d out of 100\n", x);

  return 0;
}
```

The program first copies `foo` function to a newly mapped RWX memory region. Then iterate 100 times to warm up the cache. After that, it copies `bar` function to the same memory region.

At this point, both emulator and real devices should have memory like this:

```arm
// @ptr - content of bar
mov w0, #1
ret
```

However, due to CPU cache, real devices will still have the `foo` function in the cache, while QEMU will not. So in the second loop, real devices will execute `foo` 100 times, while QEMU will execute `bar` 100 times.

## Results

On Ampere Altra and Google Pixel 7a, the cache miss rate is 0 out of 100.

On QEMU, Unicorn, Qiling (QEMU based), the cache miss rate is 100 out of 100.
