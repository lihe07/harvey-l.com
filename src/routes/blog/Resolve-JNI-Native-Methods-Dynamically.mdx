## Introduction

On Android, security critical logics are typically implemented in native code, which can be protected by binary packers such as _CrackProof_, _Promon SHIELD_, _SecNeo AppShield_, etc. These packers often obfuscate the exports of native libraryes, making it difficult to locate the native methods that need to be analyzed.

In this article, we will explore how to dynamically resolve JNI native methods on [Android Runtime (ART)](https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime) using [Frida](https://frida.re/), a powerful dynamic instrumentation toolkit.

## Requirements

- [Frida v16.x](https://frida.re/)
- Android Device/Emulator with ART (Android 5.0+)
- Obfuscated Android App

## JNI_OnLoad

When Android loads a native library (triggered by `System.loadLibrary()`), it calls the `JNI_OnLoad` function if it is defined. Packers often implement native function registration in this function.

An example of a `JNI_OnLoad` function is as follows:

```c
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM *vm, void *reserved) {
    JNIEnv *env;
    if ((*vm)->GetEnv(vm, (void**)&env, JNI_VERSION_1_6) != JNI_OK) {
        return -1;
    }

    jclass clazz = (*env)->FindClass(env, "com/example/MyNativeClass");
    if (clazz == NULL) {
        return -1;
    }

    JNINativeMethod methods[] = {
        {"nativeMethod", "(I)V", (void*)nativeMethodImpl},
        // Add more methods as needed
    };

    if ((*env)->RegisterNatives(env, clazz, methods, sizeof(methods)/sizeof(methods[0])) < 0) {
        return -1;
    }

    return JNI_VERSION_1_6;
}
```

In reality, this function is often heavily obfuscated, along with `JNINativeMethod` structures and method names.

__If we can dynamically locate the native methods in the DRAM, we can bypass the obfuscation and directly dump them.__

## Dive into ART

The native registration process in ART starts with the call to `RegisterNatives`. Searching for it in the ART source code reveals that it is implemented in `runtime/jni_internal.cc`:

```cpp
static jint RegisterNatives(JNIEnv* env,
                              jclass java_class,
                              const JNINativeMethod* methods,
                              jint method_count) {
    // ... sanity checks and other setup code ...
    for (jint i = 0; i < method_count; ++i) {
        // ...
        ArtMethod* m = FindMethod<true>(current_class.Ptr(), name, sig);
        // ...
        const void* final_function_ptr = m->RegisterNative(fnPtr);
        // ...
    }
}
```

Further, `ArtMethod::RegisterNative` is defined in `runtime/art_method.cc`:

```cpp
const void* ArtMethod::RegisterNative(const void* native_method) {
    CHECK(IsNative()) << PrettyMethod();
    CHECK(native_method != nullptr) << PrettyMethod();
    void* new_native_method = nullptr;
    Runtime::Current()->GetRuntimeCallbacks()->RegisterNativeMethod(this,
                                                                  native_method,
                                                                  /*out*/&new_native_method);
    SetEntryPointFromJni(new_native_method); // Set the EntryPoint field
    return new_native_method;
}
```

From this, we can see that the location of the native method is stored in the `EntryPoint` field of the `ArtMethod` object.
